The Challenge 

To assist Microsoft in determining which type of films to prioritize, we will conduct an analysis of the performance of various genres of recently released movies based on user ratings and box office revenue. This analysis will help Microsoft make informed decisions about which movies to produce.

1.	What types of movies are well received in terms of Genres and ratings?

MDB is a popular website among movie enthusiasts, with over 83 million users. On this platform, users can express their opinions on films by writing reviews and assigning ratings on a scale of 1-10. In this analysis, we will use IMDB average user ratings as a measure of audience reception.

To determine which genres are likely to be well-received by moviegoers, we divided the genres into three subsets of five and created histograms to visualize the data. We focused on genres that received high ratings. By analysing these bar charts, we can gain insight into which genres are most appreciated by audiences.  


2.	What types of genres are top rated and produced?
