The Challenge 

To assist Microsoft in determining which type of films to prioritize, we will conduct an analysis of the performance of various genres of recently released movies based on user ratings and box office revenue. This analysis will help Microsoft make informed decisions about which movies to produce.

1.	What types of movies are well received in terms of Genres and ratings?

MDB is a popular website among movie enthusiasts, with over 83 million users. On this platform, users can express their opinions on films by writing reviews and assigning ratings on a scale of 1-10. In this analysis, we will use IMDB average user ratings as a measure of audience reception.

To determine which genres are likely to be well-received by moviegoers, we divided the genres into three subsets of five and created histograms to visualize the data. We focused on genres that received high ratings. By analysing these bar charts, we can gain insight into which genres are most appreciated by audiences.  


2.	What types of genres are top rated and produced?



3.	Average run-time of these popular genres

Conclusion

• Top Genres that have received highest ratings are Drama, Comedy, Biography and History Microsoft should invest in these genres as they have received highest ratings compared to other genres

• Based on Top 10 Genres and total number of movies produced under these genres Microsoft should also consider Action, Roman and Thrillers as well they these genres dominate numbers of movies produced

• With a median runtime of 105.0 and a mean runtime of 107.29, we can conclude the following about the runtime data:
Half of the movies in the data have a runtime of 105.0 minutes or less, and the other half have a runtime of 105.0 minutes or more. 

The average runtime of a movie in the data is 107.29 minutes. Using these values as a reference point, we can make recommendations about the success of movies with different runtimes. For example: Movies with a runtime close to 105.0 minutes (e.g., 100-110 minutes) might tend to be more successful, as they are close to the "typical" runtime of a movie in the data. Movies with a runtime significantly above or below 105.0 minutes (e.g., less than 90 minutes or more than 120 minutes) might be less successful, as they are outside the "typical" range of runtime for the data.
